# Interrupt driven and buffered UART for tiny- and megaAVR, Version 2
**``By Hans-Henrik Fuxelius, 2023-05-24``

This UART library is loosely based on a *Technical Brief* [[TB3216](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/TB3216-Getting-Started-with-USART-DS90003216.pdf)] from **Microchip** 
that I have tried to adhere to in function and naming conventions. The library currently supports up to 4 cuncurrent UARTs and they can be enabled in any order and number as long as it is supported by the microcontroller. Each UART has its own circular buffer and code, so they work fully independent of each other.

The library support both simple sending of strings to USART as text formatted with `fprintf`

**Note 1**: In the text I have used [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter) for the library implementation and [USART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_synchronous_and_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter) for the actual device of the microcontroller which is capable of both.

**Note 2**: The compilation step (separate compilation and linking) is done on a UNIX machine (**Apple Mac**) but should be easy to compile in **Microchip Studio** as well.

## Intended devices

This library was initially developed for a [bare metal atmega4808](https://github.com/fuxelius/atmega4808_bare_metal) project. If you use the ATmega4808 and USART0 it will compile out of the box, otherwise some settings must be done before it works. The setup process of the library is direct and will be outlined below.

**P.S.** As a convenience for rapid test and evaluation, I have also [applied the uart library ](https://github.com/fuxelius/atmega_avr_uart_v2_nano_every) to the [Arduino Nano Every](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-every) with an ATmega4809 microcontroller. The setup for how to compile is detailed in [C Programming for 'Arduino Nano Every' Board (ATmega4809) with a Mac and VS Code](https://github.com/fuxelius/nano_every_bare_metal#c-programming-for-arduino-nano-every-board-atmega4809-with-a-mac-and-vs-code)

## Setting up parameters
All setting for the library is done in `uart.h` 

### RBUFFER_SIZE
	// DEFINE RING BUFFER SIZE; must be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128  
	#define RBUFFER_SIZE 32
	
> The default value is 32
	
`RBUFFER_SIZE` defines the size of the ringbuffers for Rx and Tx and even out the data flow through these units over time. It also mediates the interrupt driven design. The buffer size is symmetric and equal for both transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx). It has a typical size of 32 or 64, but can be set to any size in its range from 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128. 

### Enabling USARTn

	// ENABLE USART UNITS
	#define USART0_ENABLE
	// #define USART1_ENABLE
	// #define USART2_ENABLE
	// #define USART3_ENABLE

	
> Enable USARTn by uncommenting it, here USART0 is enabled

Depending on microcontroller, the library supports up to 4 concurrent USART units. As previously mentioned, they can be enabled in any order and number as long as it is supported by the microcontroller. Each USART has its own circular buffer and code, so they work fully independent of each other.
	

### Assign PORT, PORTMUX route and Rx, Tx Pinout

The Port Multiplexer (PORTMUX) can either enable or disable the functionality of the pins, or change between default and alternative pin positions. Available options are described in detail in the PORTMUX register map and depend on the actual pin and its properties. Select which ever is appropriate for your selection of USARTn and pin selection. [ATmega 4809 Datasheet ss. 139]

	usart_set(&usart0, &PORTA, PORTMUX_USART0_DEFAULT_gc, PIN0_bm, PIN1_bm);

> Above the default pins are used, no need to change PORTMUX. Only to enable PA02 for input and PA01 for output.

	usart_set(&usart3, &PORTB, PORTMUX_USART3_ALT1_gc, PIN4_bm, PIN5_bm);

> Above example is port multiplexing for pin PB04 and PB05 for USART3 as given in the USART library given for Arduino Nano Every. [ATmega 4809 Datasheet ss. 143]


## UART functions

The number of functions is comprehensive and easy to use.

	void usart_set(volatile usart_meta* meta, PORT_t*  port, uint8_t route, uint8_t tx_pin, uint8_t rx_pin);
	void usart_init(volatile usart_meta* meta, uint16_t baud_rate);
	void usart_send_char(volatile usart_meta* meta, char c);
	void usart_send_string(volatile usart_meta* meta, char* str, uint8_t len);
	uint16_t usart_read_char(volatile usart_meta* meta);
	void usart_close(volatile usart_meta* meta);

> The functions are common for the USART in use (0 to 3)

### File Stream
The file stream `FILE usartN_stream;` is used for printing formatted strings with `fprintf` to each USART in use

### init
Each unit must be initialized before it can operate correctly.

### send_char
Sends a single character to an USART

### send_string
Sends a complete string to USART

### read_char
Polling with read_char is used for reading input from an USART

### close
To be able to close a unit in a proper way is essential for proper operation. This makes it possible to initialize and close units as they are needed.

## How to use the library
Here is a short overview of how to use the library. The **order of calling** `usart_init()`, `sei()` and `usart_close()`, `cli()` is crucial for correct operation. A **correct session** looks like below!

	// (0) - USART settings; 
    usart_set(&usart0, &PORTA, PORTMUX_USART0_DEFAULT_gc, PIN0_bm, PIN1_bm);

    while (1) {

        // (1) - Init USART
        usart_init(&usart0, (uint16_t)BAUD_RATE(9600));

        // (2) - Enable global interrupts
        sei(); 

        // (3) - Send string to USART
        usart_send_string(&usart0, "\r\n\r\nPEACE BRO!\r\n\r\n", 18);

        // (4) - Use fprintf to write to stream
        fprintf(&usart0_stream, "Hello world!\r\n");

        for(size_t i=0; i<5; i++) {
            // (5) - Use formatted fprintf to write to stream
            fprintf(&usart0_stream, "\r\nCounter value is: 0x%02X ", j++);
            _delay_ms(500);

            // (6) - Get USART input by polling ringbuffer
            while(!((c = usart_read_char(&usart0)) & USART_NO_DATA)) {

                if (c & USART_PARITY_ERROR) {
                    fprintf(&usart0_stream, "USART PARITY ERROR: ");
                }
                if (c & USART_FRAME_ERROR) {
                    fprintf(&usart0_stream, "USART FRAME ERROR: ");
                }
                if (c & USART_BUFFER_OVERFLOW) {
                    fprintf(&usart0_stream, "USART BUFFER OVERFLOW ERROR: ");
                }

                // (7) - Send single character to USART
                usart_send_char(&usart0, (char)c);
            }
        }

        // (8) - Check that everything is printed before closing USART
        fprintf(&usart0_stream, "\r\n\r\n<-<->->");

        // (9) - Close USART0
        usart_close(&usart0);    

        // (10) - Clear global interrupts
        cli();

    }

### (0) - UART Settings
Set the PORT, PORTMUX route and selected TX PIN and RX PIN.

### (1) - Init UART
The library must be initialized **before** enabling global interrupts in step 2.

### (2) - Enable global interrupts
Once global interrupts are enabled the library starts to work, **not** before!

### (3) - Send string to UART
`usart_send_string(usart, str, len)` is the plain function for printing to USART, it has no formatting but also has a smaller library footprint than using `fprintf()`

### (4) - Use fprintf to write to UART
The created filestream `&usart0_stream` lets you write directly with `fprintf(FILE *stream, const char          *format)`

### (5) - Use formatted fprintf to write to UART
An example of *formatted printing* with `fprintf()`

### (6) - Get UART input by polling ringbuffer
All USART input and output is mediated by ringbuffers, and input from the units is done by active **polling** of the input buffer with `usart_read_char(usart)`. What you type on keyboard are printed to USART0!

### (7) - Send single character to UART
`usart_send_char(usart)` is the plain function for sending a single character to USART.

### (8) - Check that everything is printed before closing UART
This string is just a test to see that it is completely and correctly written to USART before unit is closed.

### (9) - Close UARTn
Is is important to properly being able to open and close USART devices without loosing any information. Here it loops over and over again for testing!

### (10) - Clear global interrupts
`cli()` **must** be called after `usart_close()`
